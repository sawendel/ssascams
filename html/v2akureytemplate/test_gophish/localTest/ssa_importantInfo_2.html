                    Social Security may use an Identity Services Provider to help verify your identity and protect your privacy when you register to do business with us online.&nbsp; When we verify your account, our Identity Services Provider may use information from your credit report to help confirm your identity.&nbsp; As a result, you may see a "soft inquiry" entry with the Identity Services Provider on your credit report.&nbsp; This entry shows that we made an inquiry at your request, and the date of that request.&nbsp; This soft inquiry will not appear on a credit report from any other provider. <br style="font-family: 'Arial';">
                    <br style="font-family: 'Arial';">
                    Soft inquiries are not reported to lenders and do not affect your credit score. You do not incur any charges related to them. Soft inquiries appear only on a credit report issued to you and are generally removed from your credit report within 12 months. <br style="font-family: 'Arial';">
                    <br style="font-family: 'Arial';">
                    Once you have registered for an online account, you will not create new soft inquiries when you sign in to access our services. <br style="font-family: 'Arial';">
                    <br style="font-family: 'Arial';">
