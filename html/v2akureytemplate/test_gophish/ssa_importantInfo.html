Dear Sam:<br />
<br />
Thank you for creating an online account with Social Security. You can sign in any time to <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/myaccount" onclick="return clickCaptureOverlayOn()">www.socialsecurity.gov/myaccount</a> with your username, password, and the one time security code we will send you to access Social Security&#39;s online services.<br />
<br />
We require you to choose how you want to receive your security code in order to use our online services. If you have not chosen how you want to receive your security code, follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Go to <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/myaccount" onclick="return clickCaptureOverlayOn()">www.socialsecurity.gov/myaccount</a><br />
2.&nbsp; Select Sign In.<br />
3.&nbsp; Enter your username and password.<br />
4.&nbsp; Choose how you want to receive your security code.<br />
5.&nbsp; Enter the required information.<br />
6.&nbsp; We will send an 8-digit security code to you.<br />
7.&nbsp; Enter the 8-digit security code. This 8-digit security code expires after 10 minutes and is only good for one use.<br />
<br />
Each time you sign in to your online Social Security account at <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/myaccount" onclick="return clickCaptureOverlayOn()" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">www.socialsecurity.gov/myaccount</a> we will send an 8-digit security code to you. You will enter that 8-digit security code as part of your sign in process. This 8-digit security code is only valid for 10 minutes. If you do not use it within 10 minutes, you must request another security code from the website. If applicable, text messaging charges may apply depending on your plan.<br />
<br />
If you did not make this request, call us toll-free at 1-800-772-1213. We can answer specific questions from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through Friday. Generally, you will have a shorter wait time if you call during the week after Tuesday. If you are deaf or hard of hearing, you may call our TTY number, 1-800-325-0778.<br />
<br />
Social Security may use an Identity Services Provider to help verify your identity and protect your privacy when you register to do business with us online.&nbsp; When we verify your account, our Identity Services Provider may use information from your credit report to help confirm your identity.&nbsp; As a result, you may see a &quot;soft inquiry&quot; entry with the Identity Services Provider on your credit report.&nbsp; This entry shows that we made an inquiry at your request, and the date of that request.&nbsp; This soft inquiry will not appear on a credit report from any other provider.<br />
<br />
Soft inquiries are not reported to lenders and do not affect your credit score. You do not incur any charges related to them. Soft inquiries appear only on a credit report issued to you and are generally removed from your credit report within 12 months.<br />
<br />
Once you have registered for an online account, you will not create new soft inquiries when you sign in to access our services.<br />
<br />
For more information about our Identity Services Provider, please visit <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/myaccount/verifyandprotectid.html" onclick="return clickCaptureOverlayOn()" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">www.socialsecurity.gov/myaccount/verifyandprotectid.html</a> online.<br />
<br />
Please keep your information safe.&nbsp; Do not share your password with anyone.<br />
<br />
