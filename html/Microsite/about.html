            <h2>Research Participant Information and Consent Form</h2>
            <p><strong>Study Title:</strong> Assessing Vulnerability to Social Security Scams</p>
            <p><strong>Investigator:</strong> Clifford A Robb (Phone: 608-262-3053) (Email: carobb@wisc.edu)</p>

            <div class="question">
                <h2>Description of the research</h2>
                <p>You are invited to participate in a research study about identifying Social Security scams. You have been asked to participate because you are an American adult over the age of 18. The purpose of the research is to see whether participants can correctly identify messaging from the Social Security Administration and also correctly identify fake messages claiming to be from the Social Security Administration or other government entity.  This study will include roughly 2,000 American adults over the age of 18. This research will be conducted via online surveys and emails to participants.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h2>What will my participation involve?</h2>
                <p>If you decide to participate in this research, you will be asked to distinguish between fake and real messaging directly after a brief training related to internet scams. Each participant will flag messages as fake or real, and will receive a score based on accuracy. </p>
                <p><strong>Your participation will last between 5 and 15  minutes.</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h2>Are there any risks to me?</h2>
                <p>Participants may be upset by aspects of the research, particularly if they have been subject to online fraud in the past. The study design necessarily involves a degree of deception, however, the deception is only at the level of the email and no sensitive information will be collected by the researchers and individuals will be immediately notified if they incorrectly believe a fraudulent email to be real. There is also a risk of a confidentiality breach.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h2>Are there any benefits to me?</h2>
                <p>There are no direct benefits.  However, the specific training around the nature of social security scams is in and of itself valuable information and is designed to provide protection against real scams that participants might encounter.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h2>Will I be compensated for my participation?</h2>
                <p>If you participate in this study, you will receive your usual compensation from Prolific. If you do not complete this study, you will receive no consideration.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h2>How will my confidentiality be protected?</h2>
                <p><strong>This study is confidential.</strong> Neither your name or any other identifiable information will be published.</p>
                <p>Only the study team will have access to the complete data from this study. To protect the anonymity of participants, not personal identifying information will be retained in the data. Data will also be stored on a secure server and be password protected.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question">
                <h2>Whom should I contact if I have questions?</h2>
                <p>You may ask any questions about the research at any time. If you have questions about the research after you leave today you should contact the Principal Investigator Clifford A Robb at 608-262-3053.
